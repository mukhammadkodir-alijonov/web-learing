      There are three articles in the English language: the, a, and an. These
      <br />
      are divided into two types of articles: definite (the) and indefinite 4(a,
      <br />
      an). The definite article indicates a level of specificity that the <br />
      indefinite does not. “An apple” could refer to any apple; however “the
      <br />
      apple” is referring back to a specific apple.
