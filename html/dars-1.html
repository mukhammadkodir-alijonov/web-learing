        Thus, when using the definite article, the speaker assumes the listener
        knows the identity of the noun’s <br />
        referent (because it is obvious, because it is common knowledge, <br />
        or because it was mentioned in the same sentence or an earlier
        sentence). <br />
        Use of an indefinite article implies that the speaker assumes the
        listener <br />
        does not have to be told the identity of the referent.

      <p class="puchun">
        There are three articles in the English language: the, a, and an. <br />
        These are divided into two types of articles: definite (the) and
        indefinite <br />
        (a, an). The definite article indicates a level of specificity that the
        <br />
        indefinite does not. “An apple” could refer to any apple; however “the
        apple” <br />
        is referring back to a specific apple.
